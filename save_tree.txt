We are moving away from using a single file for saves, as with the ever-growing
complexity of the game it becomes majorly inefficient. Therefore we are using
a directory based system to save games. This file outlines the directory tree
of a typical save.

Items ending in a forward slash / are folders.

NOTICE: This directory tree is NOT final in any way. This will be changed and
items appended and removed as development progresses.

Saves are stored in the following directory:
${application-data}/wof-rpg/saves

save_name/
- data/
|- quests.json
|- skill_tree.json
|- interactions.json
- world/
|- objects.json
|- map.json
- save.json
- cdata.json
